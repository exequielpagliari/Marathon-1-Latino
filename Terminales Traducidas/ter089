It is imperative that we warn Earth.Find the controls and activate them.***END MESSAGE***#briefing 9***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***You have done well.  I have sent a message to Earth.  I sent all of the information I have on the Pfhor: their behavior; their technology.  The message will arrive in ninety-two years.There has been a swift attack on the Engineering Section.  The Pfhor have brought in heavier troops, and the security details in that section of the ship are being overrun.The recent lull in the battle must have been an effort at reorganization.  We must defeat the Pfhor by subterfuge of some sort, as I am afraid we are doomed if we continue to meet them in battle.  Their resources appear limitless, and I have reason to believe there may be other Pfhor ships in nearby systems. I am sending you to the Engineering Section to rescue the security detachment.  You will have to clear the area of Aliens.Teleport when ready.***END MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
