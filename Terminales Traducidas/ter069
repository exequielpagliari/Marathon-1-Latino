I will begin the decompression process in a moment.I have finished debriefing the civilian crew you rescued a few hours ago.  They are the only group to survive prolonged contact with the Aliens that I have been able to talk with.They maintain that the Aliens were loading as many humans as possible onto shuttle craft and flying them to the Pfhor mother ship.  I have watched many such shuttles bringing supplies to the Aliens, but had no idea they were carrying humans back to the alien ship.I will brief you more on your next mission when you arrive.  You may not go exactly where I want you to end up because there is interference in the Computer Net.  Good luck.Teleport when ready.***END MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
