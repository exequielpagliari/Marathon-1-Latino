Return when you have done so.***END OF MESSAGE***#briefing 8***MESSAGE FROM LEELA***I have obtained more debriefing reports from the crew whom you rescued earlier.They have reported seeing two types of Pfhor that you have not yet encountered.  Evidently, these are two of the other "clans" which Durandal alluded to in earlier communications.  One is taller than the Fighters.  Oddly, the report indicated that this new Pfhor fired only upon other Pfhor and never on any humans.  Because of this and their general appearance, the crew who saw them referred to them as Enforcers.The other Alien was named Hunter by the crew due to its size and appearance.  It fires an energy weapon from its shoulder and is heavily armored.  Unlike the Fighters, the Hunters never take prisoners.I am sending you to the G-4 Sunbathing Landing Station.Standby to teleport.***END OF MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION ERROR***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
