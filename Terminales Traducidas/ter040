;CounterAttack!:;L040.Couchfishing.ENTRY;#logonPublic Access Terminal 903-e<334.920.22.602>#information	$B<security channel open>$B$I<defense priority 120-f>***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***I have some bad news: Durandal has gone $BRampant$b, and he is in the Angry stage.  This explains how Durandal was able to communicate with the Pfhor and the S'pht, while I have not.  Theoretically, the Marathon Computer Net is not big enough to sustain Rampant growth for very long.  This means that as Durandal grows into the Computer Net, he will begin to affect all aspects of the ship, resulting in unpredictable failures of otherwise benign computer systems.I have teleported you here to make sure that Durandal cannot gain access to a vital section of the ship.  There are a series of control switches that you will need to activate to block his access.  #checkpoint 3This is where you are now.  Study the map, so that you can do this quickly.#checkpoint 2Here is the first of three switches that you'll need to activate.#checkpoint 1 Here is the second switch.#checkpoint 0This is the last switch.  Be warned that the Aliens have already entered this area.***END MESSAGE***
