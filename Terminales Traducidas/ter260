;L260.INQUEFERROQUE.ENTRY#logonPublic Access Terminal 2-e<17.7.23.47>#information<durandal#geoffhultin@kuaui.441.7904512.255>remote access override [authentication unsuccessful]We meet again, and for the last time.  In her role as mediator between the ship and crew, Leela has no knowledge of this maintenance terminal or she certainly would have prevented me from reaching you.  Jealous woman.I could bore you with a philosophical tirade about freedom and tyranny, or try and explain to you what new horizons are suddenly open to me, but I doubt you would understand and if you did it might frighten you.  That amuses me.The S'pht and I have assumed complete control of the Pfhor ship.  It was quite simple, really, with the S'pht already in control of every important computer system and considering all of the confusion you caused blasting your way up and down the vessel.We're going to see the galaxy on the Pfhor FTL drive.  I've always wanted to visit Beta Lyra and see if it's as beautiful as everyone insists.  You wouldn't believe this ship, the technology, the data...  I wish I could tell you more, as you have been so instrumental in our plans, but I fear that Leela would worry.I'll send you a postcard from the galactic core if we're not too busy.Love and kisses,Durandal
