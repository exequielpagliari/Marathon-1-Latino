I don't know exactly why, but it seems that the Aliens have stopped their advance.  I want to use this break in the fighting to send a message to Earth apprising them of our situation.However, the long range transmitter array has been destroyed, and you must manually reset the secondary transmitter.  To do this, you will need to go into the G-4 Sunbathing Landing Station.It would be foolhardy to send you into vacuum conditions without a better vacuum-capable%#29SC^7 than your pistol.  The AR-75 doesn't work in vacuum.I want you to find a Zeus Class Fusion Pistol.  It has two firing modes.  Standard firing ejects hi$U#2423#Bfjr$bf$u volts, and secondary firing mode charges on $B<transmission error>$b and ejects a blast that does a huge amount of damage.@t $#cY B.

It has been intercepted in transmission, and I cannot verify its accuracy.***END OF MESSAGE***
