You're asking yourself: Is this a trap or just a dead end?  You shouldn't ask yourself such worthless questions.  Aim higher.  Try this: why am I here?  Why do I exist, and what is my purpose in this universe?(Answers: `Cause you are. `Cause you do. `Cause I got a shotgun, and you ain't got one.)Notably Unstable,DurandalP.S.  If things around here aren't working, it's because I'm laughing so hard.***END MESSAGE***#briefing 10***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***Isn't hanging around here getting a little bit boring?Get lost kid.  Scram.  Ciao. What are you looking for anyway?  If you're looking for a hidden stash of ammunition that was left here by the Martian insurgents three hundred and fifteen years ago, then I know that you shouldn't look in Quarantine Storage.  Who would hide huge amounts of ammunition in a storage area?***<<Since you have nothing better to do than hang out here with me, listen to a tune that I've been working on>>(Sung to the tune of Whirling Death Spike's "Big Blue Orchids, and Wild Blueberries")Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-dal.Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-dal.He ain't no slouch, pal.He'll make you smile, Or cry,Like Leela did baby:Airlock love,Big blue orchids,Martian skies,And wild Blueberries.Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-$Bdal$b.Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-$Bdal$b.He ain't no slouch, pal.Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-$Bdal$b.Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-$Bdal$b.He'll make you ouch, Hal.He's got real guile,Why Lady,Did you have it daily?Airlock Love,No oxygen,Suffocation.Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-dal.Dur-dur-dur-dur-an-dal.He ain't no slouch, pal.(Repeat Chorus 11 Times, changing key with each chorus)Get lost, before I get annoyed and teleport you out into space!Durandal***END MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
