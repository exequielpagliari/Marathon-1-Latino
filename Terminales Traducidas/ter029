There is no point in going to the Defense Center unless you have all three.  Search until you have found them.***END MESSAGE***#briefing 3***MESSAGE FROM LEELA***Good job.I have received reports from some human security forces.  They agree that the Aliens are concentrating on the aft Engineering Section.  I would conjecture that they will try to shut down the Marathon's reactors.Your next mission will be to put the Automatic Defenses on-line.  I will give you exact information when you arrive.Teleport when ready.***END MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
