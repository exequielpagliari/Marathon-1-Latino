With every passing moment, the opportunity for us to counterattack is fading.***END MESSAGE***#briefing 4***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***Well done!I have detected Defense Drones activating all over the ship.  Reports from security forces are jubilant.  Now, the Pfhor will encounter stiff resistance, and they will have to pay in blood for every move.The colony appears to be under attack.  I detected seven Pfhor dropships entering the atmosphere only minutes ago.  Trajectory analysis indicates that the ships were heading for the outskirts of the colony.  Shortly thereafter, I lost communications with the colony. Something has come to my attention, I will inform you after you teleport.Teleport now.***End Message***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
