;Beginning of counterattack;L030.MAD.ENTRY#logonDefense Access 40-a <tpr-A21H.43.21.123>#information***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***I have received a preliminary report from some members of the science staff who have finished post-mortem examinations on three kinds of Aliens.  They report that by modern genealogical standards the different Aliens belong to different $Bspecies$b.  I have been collecting as much information as I can and will give you a report shortly.I have established contact with Durandal for the first time since the attack.  He seems to have sustained less damage than I had previously suspected.  Durandal reports that he has been in communication with the Aliens.  He says that the Aliens behind the invasion call themselves the Pfhor, and that the ones attacking the computer net are called S'pht.  But he was reluctant to share the details of his communication and I cannot understand this.Your mission here is rather simple.  You must insert the circuits in the Defense Control terminals.  #checkpoint 5This is your current location.#checkpoint 4There is a shield recharge in the Access Control Room.#checkpoint 3Here is a supply room with a large supply of ammunition and weapons.  You should stop in this room.#checkpoint 2This is the Defense Control Center.  Hopefully, the new control circuits will work.  Place one in the terminal at this location.#checkpoint 1This is where to place a second one.#checkpoint 0This is the final location. Good luck.***END MESSAGE***
