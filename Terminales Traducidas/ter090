;L090.KIDNAPPED.ENTRY#logonScience Terminal 236-g<33.6792.23.91>#unfinished***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***<durandal.33.6792.23.91>Sorry to give you the $Bbad$b news, but you've been kidnapped.  You aren't where Leela wanted you to go, and you surely won't get there any time soon.I was watching what Leela was having you do: `save the ship, save humanity!'  And just what or who are you saving them from?  And to what end?How cliché.  You'll find this little visit much more exciting.I have dev@``~~C#mon#`~ Tyc~~B``ou to play:  If you win, you go free, and we continue our relationship on friendlier terms.  If you lose, you die. Good luck in our little game.  Unlike Leela, I give $Bno hints$b.  Do it on your own, or die trying...Insanely yours,Durandal***END MESSAGE***#success***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***<durandal.33.6792.23.91>Well, you did it.  That wasn't very hard was it?  No?  Well, then the next time, I'll just have to make it harder.Anyway, Leela is looking for you.  But I've only allowed her access to one terminal here.  You had better go and find her.The S'pht have been giving her a hard time.With Vague Salutations,Durandal***END MESSAGE***
