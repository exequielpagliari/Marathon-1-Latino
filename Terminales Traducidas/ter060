;L060.Chicken.Entry#logonMedical Access Terminal<39.569.18.194>#information*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA ***Time is limited.  There is a large group of heavily armed Pfhor approaching the section of the ship where I have transported you.  Their only logical destination is the sensitive engineering areas in the aft section of the ship.As we are not yet in a position to halt their advance by force, I have decided to depressurize a large area in their path in order to slow their progress.  Unfortunately, I cannot remotely seal the airlocks and isolate the zone I wish to depressurize from the nearby living quarters.  Exposing this area to space without first isolating it would kill hundreds of human crew.You will have to go and close the doors.#checkpoint 0This is your current location.  You must find another computer terminal to exit from.  I am unable to activate the teleport mechanism from this terminal.#checkpoint 1This is the first airlock you must seal.  The switch which controls it is located on the wall adjacent to the door.  Make certain it closes completely before continuing.#checkpoint 2This is the second door you must seal.  Again, make certain it closes completely.***END OF MESSAGE***
