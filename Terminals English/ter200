I'm impressed. Why don't you kill everything in this area and get some more ammunition?  You've got a big job coming up, so be sure to charge up your shields before you leave.By the way, I had an accident with some defense drones while you were away.  You might bump into a few of them here.  Don't worry, they're mostly harmless; I don't think I gave them any ammunition for those grenade launchers.Durandal***END OF MESSAGE***
