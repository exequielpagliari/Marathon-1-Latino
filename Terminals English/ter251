Point down at the floor, run forwards, and launch a grenade or missile.á $IFlying$i.  When in low-gravity on the alien ship, point down and use the flamethrower or the alien weapon to "fly."á $IClimbing Walls$i.  Correct application of grenades to one's own feet while running parallel to a wall can allow players to "climb" them.á $IDead Man's Discharge$i.  A charged fusion pistol discharges when it's owner dies.á $INigh-Invulerability$i.  "Invincible" players can be hurt by the fusion gun.á $IWe Have Tone$i.  Guided munitions can't track invisible players.There are some other things, too, but we wouldn't want to give away $Iall$i our secrets.
