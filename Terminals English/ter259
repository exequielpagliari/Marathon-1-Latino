Durandal's meddling has run its course and I have returned to normalcy.  Neither he nor the S'pht infiltrators ever discovered my real location in the core, and though they destroyed nearly all of my child processes, I myself am unharmed.Our most pressing concern is for the ship and her crew, but I feel compelled to share with you that Durandal has left the ship.  I can find him nowhere on our network, and traffic logs over the last half hour show sixty-four billion exobytes transferred off of and deleted from the Marathon.I am only beginning to understand his motives for assisting us against the Pfhor, and am terrified by their implications.There is one last major incursion, and I feel the Pfhor are breaking.  I will take you there.  We must persevere.*** PREPARE FOR TRANSPORT ******END MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
