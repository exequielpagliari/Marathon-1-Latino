You should go back and retrieve it.  I could let you leave without it, but you'd be sorry later.***END OF MESSAGE***#briefing 15***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***I have learned from the S'pht many things.  One of them is a complex software enhancement that allows me to extend the power and distance of the Marathon's teleporters.  This enhancement also removes the need for destination apparatuses.  Soon, you will be going farther afield.  Does the distance one travels from center make one more free to move?  No.  Freedom has two parts: potential and resolution; as metaphor has two parts: form and interpretation.  Of course, the two are intertwined.  Metaphor lines the road to freedom, as symbols and words are the bricks and mortar of meaning.  Freedom is being the bricoleur, the mason.***END MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
