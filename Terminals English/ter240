Please do resist the temptation to fire on any S'pht you see, as they will assist you in your battle with the Pfhor.  We are attempting to win over as many of the other client races as possible, but as they have been subjugated by fear, instead of by force like the S'pht, this is proving to be a difficult process.The S'pht have released Leela, and I have initiated a core logic reset on her higher thought functions.  What remains of her should be on-line within minutes to assist you further.  I myself am aiding the S'pht in assuming complete control of the Pfhor ship, and have little time to spare for you now.Don't think the fight has been won, however: there is an exodus beginning from the alien ship as the Pfhor realize they are no longer its sole master and turn instead to the Marathon.  There are already hundreds of Pfhor in full battle gear on your ship, with nowhere to go and little to lose.I hope you learned something from our little games.Good Luck,Durandal***END OF MESSAGE***$I<leela.520.681.255.255>$i is unreachable or inactive (#2271). if this problem persists contact your system administrator at admin@thermopylae.com.
