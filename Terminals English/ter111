I am able to access all sections of the ship, and the S'pht have even stopped attacking me- realizing the futility of the enterprise.Here's a little hint, you'll probably need the help:#checkpoint 0If you want to live, go here and look for a hidden airlock panel.#checkpoint 1Err,  maybe it was here.#checkpoint 2No.  I remember now.  It was here.  Yeah, that's it.  This was the place.  #checkpoint 3I'm sorry.  Could this be it?  It looks like it.  I can't find the right map.  Try talking to Leela.  She always was a nice AI.  She could help you.  Oh, right.  Leela can't get here.$BDecompression Completed.$b#checkpoint 4Just kidding.  This is the place.Side note:The S'pht have informed me that he Pfhor are building cyborg simulacrums of the Marathon crew.  I imagine that you will meet some of them soon, and wanted to warn you not to get too close to them: about three meters.***END OF MESSAGE***
