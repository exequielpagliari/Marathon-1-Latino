This is a fact-finding mission.  You should explore as much as possible.Stop in front of a window.  If you stop and are not teleported, then either I can't lock onto your teleport beacon, or else I feel you haven't explored the area thoroughly enough.I will be watching everything.***END MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
